## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

One of the many issues facing museums which focus indigenous American art and culture is the lackluster education most Americans receive on indigenous peoples, their history, and modern presence. It is easy for many to perceive the art of indigenous Americans as disjunct from their culture and isolated in time, happening either in the past or current moment, but lacking a historical timeline which winds its way through all of American history. To help rectify this, I propose a digital experience which accompanies visitors during their tours of the Eiteljorg exhibits. This app would be available on screens placed at exhibit entrances and via QR code. It would primarily consist of a timeline (designed to line up with exhibit displays) of indigenous art, noting who produced it, where it was made, and when.


### Core Webpages

The core of the app would be an interactive map and timeline. This timeline would trace different artistic forms from their origins to their present expressions and include links to artist and their art. The map would display north america and include markers (with an accompanying image and link) of notable artwork. The aim of the map display is to help viewers get a sense of the different lineages of indigenous art and where they are from in the US and Canada. Contemporary artists would also whose work is displayed in the Eiteljorg would also be featured on an artists page.


### Design Choices

The layout of each page would be relatively simple, with one primary feature per page. Colors would match or be analogous to the colors of the Eiteljorg museum building itself (warm brown/tan for the navigation, beige for text sections). Shapes and patterns similar to those found in the building could also be used for decorative elements or used as low-opacity background images.
The timeline and map displays and entries would be handled by JS, with an external database handling each entry and its basic information. This would allow for entries to be dropped in without needing to rearrange the page html.
