## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

A website generally contains information with limited interactivity. A web application is a website/page with significant interactivity and most web applications a generally geared towards a specific process. Examples of web apllications include google docs, google and apple maps, etc.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS code is a code editing software. VS code can also be linked to github via git for version control. VS code extensions add functionality to VS code.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version control refers to the management of code changes and file/project versions. This helps avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on one project. GitHub is perhaps the most ubiquitous version control system. Git is used to push and pull code between VS code and GitHub.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a markup language that can be used to write text that can be converted to HTML. Markdown is often used to write documentation and can also be used to write/format web pages. Documentation is often just as useful to the original code author as it is to others looking at someone elses code.
