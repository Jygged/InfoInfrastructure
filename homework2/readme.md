### Blog Topic Summary

Some pictures from a hike in the Sagre de Cristo Mountains from a few years ago.

### Key Takeaways

Overall, I tried to mimic the structure of the html shown in class, spliting things into sections where it made sense. I put most of the page in an article containers so I could use a flex-column layout. Unfortunatly I couldn't figure out how to get the <p> tags to obey the column or flex width, so I set the width manually. I also used background images instead of an <img> tag so I could more easily constrain the image size. I'm sure there's a better way to do this but I can't remember it.
